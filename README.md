# <center>OCR with Python</center>

## Introduction
Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, is a common task in many domains. The earliest OCR systems were designed to serve the vision impaired. Its modern application, however, has extended to a far wider population. The goal of OCR is to take an input image and output raw text while maintaining the structure of the text in the image. In othere words, its end-goal is to preserve the line breaks, paragraph segmentation, and other features of the structure of the text on the page.

Workflow Overview

The OCR process in this project can be broken down into three main steps:

Image Preprocessing with PIL --->
Advanced Image Processing with OpenCV --->
Text Extraction with TesseractPY
