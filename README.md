<h1>OCR for Blind People</h1>
<hr><p>Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, is a common task in many domains. The earliest OCR systems were designed to serve the vision impaired. Its modern application, however, has extended to a far wider population. The goal of OCR is to take an input image and output raw text while maintaining the structure of the text in the image. In othere words, its end-goal is to preserve the line breaks, paragraph segmentation, and other features of the structure of the text on the page.</p><h2>General Information</h2>
<hr><ul>
<li>This project demonstrates a complete OCR workflow using Python.
It utilizes three powerful libraries: Pillow (PIL), OpenCV, and TesseractPY.
The project includes image preprocessing, advanced image processing, and text extraction.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>OCR with Python solves the problem of converting printed or handwritten text in images into machine-readable text.</li>
